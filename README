<cfspreadsheet> for Railo

This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/cfpoi/ for Railo so a massive thank you must go out to Matt Woodward (www.mattwoodward.com / @mpwoodward) as he has done all the hard work for this project I am just forking it to make it workable with Railo as an extension.

At the moment this should be considered alpha/beta as it needs some full testing to be done. It is currently working for my limited needs but it requires feedback before being considered as stable.

Latest Version 

For the latest version, please download the cfSpreadSheetIntaller.zip file

To install

log in to your Web Administrator and add http://www.andyjarrett.co.uk/RailoExtensionProvider/ExtensionProvider.cfc to your Providers (under Extension)
Then go to Applications (still under Extension) and install "CFPOI, a wrapper for the Apache POI Project."
Once done you will need to restart your Railo server.
With your server restarted you should be able to use the cfspreadsheet functions and tags.
